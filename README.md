Here is a 3D interactive Virtual Reality simulation I've been working on called Esfera!
It is in the very early stages of functionality and uses a VR simulator so far.

In this repo you can view some of the picture of development, and some of the source code.
I've been developing it so far using C#, Blender, and Unity.
